	<h1>Grade Calculator</h1>
	<h2>By: D.J. Anderson</h2>
	<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
	<p>The purpose of the Grade Calculator web application is to provide students with a tool they can use to keep track of their grades. Many classes,
	especially in college, have professors that never post any of their grades online which means that students are never able to see their average score
	in the class. Professors tend to keep their own records, and the letter grade that appears in SIS after a long and difficult semester seems to be
	hidden by the professor's calculations performed behind-the-scenes. Once they see their final grades, students are unaware if the professor has done
	any curving to the class or if the grade is truly accurate. With this web application, students will be able to maintain records of their own grades
	throughout the course of the semester.</p>
	<h3>Overview of User Base</h3>
	<p>The user base of this web application is geared toward UVa students. However, middle-schoolers through graduate students from any school would
	enjoy the features of this app. It is not meant for teachers or professors to keep track of their students' grades at this point, although a slightly
	different layout and possibly two separate accounts (a student account and a teacher account) could accommodate for this feature in the future. For
	right now, we will stick to just the student account.</p>
	<h3>Usability Goals and Requirements</h3>
	<p>Below is a list containing a majority of the usability goals for this web application.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Users should be able to create an account on the login page if they have never created an account before. Otherwise, they should be able to
		login using their previously-created username and password.</li>
		<li>Upon successful login, users should be faced with a welcome page. This welcome page will be the main page of the application that allows users
		to navigate across the various features of the app. The top of the page should be personalized to the user (i.e. it would say "Welcome, [first
		name] [last name]!" instead of a generic "Hello, Student!"). On this page, the user should be able to view all the features and begin interacting
		with the app.</li>
		<li>Users will be able to "create a class." This will prompt the user to indicate the class title, the number of credits the class is worth, the
		grading scale of the class, and whether the class is based on points or weighted grades. If points, the class gets created and now appears to the
		user. If weighted grades, the user must enter each of the categories and the percentage of the final grade that corresponds to that category.</li>
		<li>Inside a class that the user has created, users should be faced with a grade calculator page where the user can enter all their grades for
		a particular class and instantly see their overall grade in the class.</li>
		<li>Users will be able to remove grades they have entered inside a class.</li>
		<li>Users will be able to find out what minimum grade they can receive on a particular assignment in order to stay above a certain percentage in
		the class. This functionality will be provided in the form of a button that asks the user to input such information as the point value (for points
		system), the category (for weighted system), and their goal grade for the class. Then, a value will be returned to them indicating this minimum
		grade they can receive on the assignment.</li>
		<li>When the user logs out and logs back in at a later time, the application should be able to retrieve all the classes that a user has previously
		created as well as the grades table that corresponds to each class.</li>
		<li>At the end of a semester, users should be able to override their grades with the grades they actually received from the professor.</li>
		<li>Users will be able to see their GPA on the main welcome page of the application that considers all the classes and grades they have in the
		system.</li>
		<li>Users should be able to easily figure out how to perform actions on the webpage. All of the buttons' functions and capabilities should be
		intuitive, and the user should not become frustrated when trying to interact with the application.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Database Storage and Design</h3>
	<p>The database should contain three tables: a users table, a classes table, and a grades table.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The users table would contain the user's first name, last name, username (email), password, registration date, and school. The primary key for
		the users table would be username.</li>
		<li>The classes table would contain the user's username, class title, number of credits, grading scale, points/weighted system, categories
		(maximum of 10), and weights for each of those categories. The foreign keys for the classes table would be username which would reference the
		username field of the users table. The primary keys for the classes table would be username and class title.</li>
		<li>Finally, the grades table would contain the user's username, class title, category (if applicable), weight (if applicable), assignment name,
		points earned, and points possible. The foreign keys for the grades table would be username which would reference the username field of the users
		table and the class title which would reference the class title field of the classes table. The primary keys for the grades table would be
		username, class title, and assignment name.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Milestone</h3>
	<p>For the milestone presentation on Wednesday, June 7, 2017, I plan on having the design for all of the HTML pages laid out. I also plan on having
	the model, view, and controller PHP pages finished. Sample data will be stored inside the database to ensure that the SQL commands are correct and
	that view PHP page displays the correct JSON object for all the functions. Generating the SQL commands and creating all the functions for each feature
	of my grade calculator web application will likely be the most difficult part of this project. Later, the JSON objects generated by the PHP will be
	linked to the HTML through JavaScript, which will format the JSON data nicely into tables. Then, the website will undergo testing to ensure that the
	website is usable, and it should be ready to present on Friday, June 9, 2017.</p>
