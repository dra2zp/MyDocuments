(** In previous chapters, we have seen many examples of factual
    claims (_propositions_) and ways of presenting evidence of their
    truth (_proofs_).  In particular, we have worked extensively with
    _equality propositions_ of the form [e1 = e2], with
    implications ([P -> Q]), and with quantified propositions ([forall
    x, P]).  In this chapter, we will see how Coq can be used to carry
    out other familiar forms of logical reasoning.

    Before diving into details, let's talk a bit about the status of
    mathematical statements in Coq.  Recall that Coq is a _typed_
    language, which means that every sensible expression in its world
    has an associated type.  Logical claims are no exception: any
    statement we might try to prove in Coq has a type, namely [Prop],
    the type of _propositions_.  We can see this with the [Check]
    command: *)

Check 3 = 3.
(* ===> Prop *)

Check forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n.
(* ===> Prop *)

(** Note that _all_ syntactically well-formed propositions have type
    [Prop] in Coq, regardless of whether they are true or not. *)

(** Simply _being_ a proposition is one thing; being _provable_ is
    something else! *)

Check 2 = 2.
(* ===> Prop *)

Check forall n : nat, n = 2.
(* ===> Prop *)

Check 3 = 4.
(* ===> Prop *)

(** Indeed, propositions don't just have types: they are
    _first-class objects_ that can be manipulated in the same ways as
    the other entities in Coq's world. *)

(*
For example, we can write programs that take ordinary
arguments and that return propositions as results.. Here, for example,
is a program that takes a [nat], n, and returns the proposition that [n]
is equal to zero.
*)

Definition isZero (n: nat): Prop := (n = 0).

Compute isZero 1.

(*
Thus we have a proposition generator. We can use it to generate
propositions that we can then try to prove.
*)

Theorem oneIsZero: isZero 1.
Proof. unfold isZero. Abort.

Theorem zeroIsZero: isZero 0.
Proof. reflexivity. (* Does automatic unfolding in attempt to generate
                       proof. *) Qed.

(*
We could have written the program in a slightly different manner.
*)

Definition isZero': nat -> Prop :=
  fun n: nat => n = 0.

Compute (isZero' 1).

(*
Written in this manner makes it clear that [isZero] is a property
of natural numbers. It's the property of "being zero", and of course
only one [nat] actually has the property (a proof of the corresponding
porposition), namely 0. More generally, we can represent a property
of objects of some type, [T], as a function from [T] to [Prop].
*)

Definition isNil (A: Type): list A -> Prop :=
  fun l => (l = []).

Compute isNil nat [1;2;3].

Theorem nillsNil: (isNil nat) [].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem notNillsNil: isNil nat [0].
Proof. unfold isNil. Abort.

(** So far, we've seen one primary place that propositions can appear:
    in [Theorem] (and [Lemma] and [Example]) declarations. *)

Theorem plus_2_2_is_4 :
  2 + 2 = 4.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** But propositions can be used in many other ways.  For example, we
    can give a name to a proposition using a [Definition], just as we
    have given names to expressions of other sorts. *)

Definition plus_fact : Prop := 2 + 2 = 4.
Check plus_fact.
(* ===> plus_fact : Prop *)

(** We can later use this name in any situation where a proposition is
    expected -- for example, as the claim in a [Theorem] declaration. *)

Theorem plus_fact_is_true :
  plus_fact.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** We can also write _parameterized_ propositions -- that is,
    functions that take arguments of some type and return a
    proposition. *)

(** For instance, the following function takes a number
    and returns a proposition asserting that this number is equal to
    three: *)

Definition is_three (n : nat) : Prop :=
  n = 3.
Check is_three.
(* ===> nat -> Prop *)

(** In Coq, functions that return propositions are said to define
    _properties_ of their arguments. 

    For instance, here's a (polymorphic) property defining the
    familiar notion of an _injective function_. *)

Definition injective {A B} (f : A -> B) :=
  forall x y : A, f x = f y -> x = y.

Compute injective S.

Lemma succ_inj : injective S.
Proof.
  (* optional *) unfold injective.
  intros n m H. inversion H. reflexivity.
Qed.

Lemma pred_inj: injective pred.
Proof.
  (* Is [pred] actually injective? What happens when we try to prove
     it? *)
  unfold injective. intros n m H. inversion H. (* Why doesn't this
                                                  work? *) Abort.

(** The equality operator [=] is also a function that returns a
    [Prop].

    The expression [n = m] is syntactic sugar for [eq n m], defined
    using Coq's [Notation] mechanism. Because [eq] can be used with
    elements of any type, it is also polymorphic: *)

Check @eq.
(* ===> forall A : Type, A -> A -> Prop *)

(** (Notice that we wrote [@eq] instead of [eq]: The type
    argument [A] to [eq] is declared as implicit, so we need to turn
    off implicit arguments to see the full type of [eq].) *)

Compute eq 1 1.

(** * Logical Connectives *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Conjunction *)

(** The _conjunction_ (or _logical and_) of propositions [A] and [B]
    is written [A /\ B], representing the claim that both [A] and [B]
    are true. *)

Example and_example : 3 + 4 = 7 /\ 2 * 2 = 4.

(** To prove a conjunction, use the [split] tactic.  It will generate
    two subgoals, one for each part of the statement: *)

Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  split.
  - (* 3 + 4 = 7 *) reflexivity.
  - (* 2 + 2 = 4 *) reflexivity.
Qed.

Print and_example.

(** For any propositions [A] and [B], if we assume that [A] is true
    and we assume that [B] is true, we can conclude that [A /\ B] is
    also true. *)

Lemma and_intro : forall A B : Prop, A -> B -> A /\ B.
Proof.
  intros A B HA HB. split.
  - apply HA.
  - apply HB.
Qed.

(** Since applying a theorem with hypotheses to some goal has the
    effect of generating as many subgoals as there are hypotheses for
    that theorem, we can apply [and_intro] to achieve the same effect
    as [split]. *)

Example and_example' : 3 + 4 = 7 /\ 2 * 2 = 4.
Proof.
  apply and_intro.
  - (* 3 + 4 = 7 *) reflexivity.
  - (* 2 + 2 = 4 *) reflexivity.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (and_exercise)  *)
Example and_exercise :
  forall n m : nat, n + m = 0 -> n = 0 /\ m = 0.
Proof. intros n m H. induction n.
  - split. reflexivity. apply H.
  - split. inversion H. inversion H.
Qed.

(** So much for proving conjunctive statements.  To go in the other
    direction -- i.e., to _use_ a conjunctive hypothesis to help prove
    something else -- we employ the [destruct] tactic.

    If the proof context contains a hypothesis [H] of the form
    [A /\ B], writing [destruct H as [HA HB]] will remove [H] from the
    context and add two new hypotheses: [HA], stating that [A] is
    true, and [HB], stating that [B] is true.  *)

Lemma and_example2 :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros n m H.
  destruct H as [Hn Hm].
  rewrite Hn. rewrite Hm.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** As usual, we can also destruct [H] right when we introduce it,
    instead of introducing and then destructing it: *)

Lemma and_example2' :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  intros n m [Hn Hm].
  rewrite Hn. rewrite Hm.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** You may wonder why we bothered packing the two hypotheses [n = 0]
    and [m = 0] into a single conjunction, since we could have also
    stated the theorem with two separate premises: *)

Lemma and_example2'' :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 -> m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  intros n m Hn Hm.
  rewrite Hn. rewrite Hm.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** For this theorem, both formulations are fine.  But it's important
    to understand how to work with conjunctive hypotheses because
    conjunctions often arise from intermediate steps in proofs,
    especially in bigger developments.  Here's a simple example: *)

Lemma and_example3 :
  forall n m : nat, n + m = 0 -> n * m = 0.
Proof.
  intros n m H.
  assert (H' : n = 0 /\ m = 0).
  { apply and_exercise. apply H. }
  destruct H' as [Hn Hm].
  rewrite Hn. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Another common situation with conjunctions is that we know
    [A /\ B] but in some context we need just [A] (or just [B]).
    The following lemmas are useful in such cases: *)

Lemma proj1 : forall P Q : Prop,
  P /\ Q -> P.
Proof.
  intros P Q [HP HQ].
  apply HP.  Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, optional (proj2)  *)
Lemma proj2 : forall P Q : Prop,
  P /\ Q -> Q.
Proof. intros P Q [HP HQ]. apply HQ. Qed.

(** Finally, we sometimes need to rearrange the order of conjunctions
    and/or the grouping of multi-way conjunctions.  The following
    commutativity and associativity theorems are handy in such
    cases. *)

Theorem and_commut : forall P Q : Prop,
  P /\ Q -> Q /\ P.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros P Q [HP HQ].
  split.
    - (* left *) apply HQ.
    - (* right *) apply HP.  Qed.
  
(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (and_assoc)  *)
(** (In the following proof of associativity, notice how the _nested_
    intro pattern breaks the hypothesis [H : P /\ (Q /\ R)] down into
    [HP : P], [HQ : Q], and [HR : R].  Finish the proof from
    there.) *)

Theorem and_assoc : forall P Q R : Prop,
  P /\ (Q /\ R) -> (P /\ Q) /\ R.
Proof.
  intros P Q R [HP [HQ HR]]. split.
  - split. apply HP. apply HQ.
  - apply HR.
Qed.

(** By the way, the infix notation [/\] is actually just syntactic
    sugar for [and A B].  That is, [and] is a Coq operator that takes
    two propositions as arguments and yields a proposition. *)

Check and.
(* ===> and : Prop -> Prop -> Prop *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Disjunction *)

(** Another important connective is the _disjunction_, or _logical or_
    of two propositions: [A \/ B] is true when either [A] or [B]
    is.  (Alternatively, we can write [or A B], where [or : Prop ->
    Prop -> Prop].) *)

(** To use a disjunctive hypothesis in a proof, we proceed by case
    analysis, which, as for [nat] or other data types, can be done
    with [destruct] or [intros].  Here is an example: *)

Lemma or_example :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 \/ m = 0 -> n * m = 0.
Proof.
  (* This pattern implicitly does case analysis on
     [n = 0 \/ m = 0] *)
  intros n m [Hn | Hm].
  - (* Here, [n = 0] *)
    rewrite Hn. reflexivity.
  - (* Here, [m = 0] *)
    rewrite Hm. rewrite <- mult_n_O.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Conversely, to show that a disjunction holds, we need to show that
    one of its sides does. This is done via two tactics, [left] and
    [right].  As their names imply, the first one requires
    proving the left side of the disjunction, while the second
    requires proving its right side.  Here is a trivial use... *)

Lemma or_intro : forall A B : Prop, A -> A \/ B.
Proof.
  intros A B HA.
  left.
  apply HA.
Qed.

(** ... and a slightly more interesting example requiring both [left]
    and [right]: *)

Lemma zero_or_succ :
  forall n : nat, n = 0 \/ n = S (pred n).

  - intros [|m]. intros H. rewrite mult_0_r in H. right. apply H.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Falsehood and Negation *)

(** So far, we have mostly been concerned with proving that certain
    things are _true_ -- addition is commutative, appending lists is
    associative, etc.  Of course, we may also be interested in
    _negative_ results, showing that certain propositions are _not_
    true. In Coq, such negative statements are expressed with the
    negation operator [~]. *)

(** To see how negation works, recall the discussion of the _principle
    of explosion_ from the [Tactics] chapter; it asserts that, if we
    assume a contradiction, then any other proposition can be derived.
    Following this intuition, we could define [~ P] ("not [P]") as
    [forall Q, P -> Q].  Coq actually makes a slightly different
    choice, defining [~ P] as [P -> False], where [False] is a
    particular contradictory proposition defined in the standard
    library. *)

Module MyNot.

Definition not (P:Prop) := P -> False.

(*
Critical to understand that False is a proposition
with no proofs. We thus define [not(P)] as a proposition,
P -> False. But of course a proof of this proposition is just
a function that, if given a proof of [P], returns a proof of [False].
But, as we've said, there is no such object; so there can be
no such function, either.
*)

Notation "~ x" := (not x) : type_scope.

Check not.
(* ===> Prop -> Prop *)

End MyNot.

(** Since [False] is a contradictory proposition, the principle of
    explosion also applies to it. If we get [False] into the proof
    context, we can use [destruct] (or [inversion]) on it to complete
    any goal: *)

Theorem ex_falso_quodlibet : forall (P:Prop),
  False -> P.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros P contra.
  destruct contra.  Qed.

(** The Latin _ex falso quodlibet_ means, literally, "from falsehood
    follows whatever you like"; this is another common name for the
    principle of explosion. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, optional (not_implies_our_not)  *)

    mentioned above: *)

(** It takes a little practice to get used to working with negation in

    involving negation is true, it can be a little tricky at first to
    get things into the right configuration so that Coq can understand
    it!  Here are proofs of a few familiar facts to get you warmed
    up. *)

(** [] *)

(** Similarly, since inequality involves a negation, it requires a
    little practice to be able to work with it fluently.  Here is one
    useful trick.  If you are trying to prove a goal that is
    nonsensical (e.g., the goal state is [false = true]), apply
    [ex_falso_quodlibet] to change the goal to [False].  This makes it
    easier to use assumptions of the form [~P] that may be available
    in the context -- in particular, assumptions of the form
    [x<>y]. *)

Theorem not_true_is_false : forall b : bool,
  b <> true -> b = false.

  - (* b = false *)

(** Since reasoning with [ex_falso_quodlibet] is quite common, Coq
    provides a built-in tactic, [exfalso], for applying it. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Truth *)

(** Besides [False], Coq's standard library also defines [True], a
    proposition that is trivially true. To prove it, we use the
    predefined constant [I : True]: *)

Lemma True_is_true : True.
Proof. apply I. Qed.

(** Unlike [False], which is used extensively, [True] is used quite
    rarely, since it is trivial (and therefore uninteresting) to prove
    as a goal, and it carries no useful information as a hypothesis.
    But it can be quite useful when defining complex [Prop]s using
    conditionals or as a parameter to higher-order [Prop]s.  We will
    see examples of such uses of [True] later on.
*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Logical Equivalence *)

(** The handy "if and only if" connective, which asserts that two

(** ** Existential Quantification *)

(** Another important logical connective is _existential
    quantification_.  To say that there is some [x] of type [T] such
    that some property [P] holds of [x], we write [exists x : T,
    P]. As with [forall], the type annotation [: T] can be omitted if
    Coq is able to infer from the context what the type of [x] should
    be. *)

(** To prove a statement of the form [exists x, P], we must show that
    [P] holds for some specific choice of value for [x], known as the
    _witness_ of the existential.  This is done in two steps: First,
    we explicitly tell Coq which witness [t] we have in mind by
    invoking the tactic [exists t].  Then we prove that [P] holds after
    all occurrences of [x] are replaced by [t]. *)

(** * Programming with Propositions *)

(** The logical connectives that we have seen provide a rich
    vocabulary for defining complex propositions from simpler ones.
    To illustrate, let's look at how to express the claim that an
    element [x] occurs in a list [l].  Notice that this property has a
    simple recursive structure: *)
(**    - If [l] is the empty list, then [x] cannot occur on it, so the
         property "[x] appears in [l]" is simply false. *)
(**    - Otherwise, [l] has the form [x' :: l'].  In this case, [x]
         occurs in [l] if either it is equal to [x'] or it occurs in
         [l']. *)

(** We can translate this directly into a straightforward recursive
    function from taking an element and a list and returning a
    proposition: *)

Fixpoint In {A : Type} (x : A) (l : list A) : Prop :=
  match l with
  | [] => False
  | x' :: l' => x' = x \/ In x l'
  end.

(** When [In] is applied to a concrete list, it expands into a
    concrete sequence of nested disjunctions. *)

  - exists 2. rewrite <- H. reflexivity.

(** (Notice the use of the empty pattern to discharge the last case
    _en passant_.) *)

(** We can also prove more generic, higher-level lemmas about [In].

    Note, in the next, how [In] starts out applied to a variable and
    only gets expanded when we do case analysis on this variable: *)

Lemma In_map :
  forall (A B : Type) (f : A -> B) (l : list A) (x : A),
    In x l ->
    In (f x) (map f l).
Proof.
  intros A B f l x.

  - (* l = x' :: l' *)

    + right. apply IHl'. apply H.
Qed.

(** This way of defining propositions recursively, though convenient
    in some cases, also has some drawbacks.  In particular, it is
    subject to Coq's usual restrictions regarding the definition of
    recursive functions, e.g., the requirement that they be "obviously
    terminating."  In the next chapter, we will see how to define
    propositions _inductively_, a different technique with its own set
    of strengths and limitations. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, recommended (All)  *)
(** Recall that functions returning propositions can be seen as

    stating that some property [P] holds of all elements of a list
    [l]. To make sure your definition is correct, prove the [All_In]

(** * Applying Theorems to Arguments *)

(** One feature of Coq that distinguishes it from many other proof
    assistants is that it treats _proofs_ as first-class objects.

    There is a great deal to be said about this, but it is not
    necessary to understand it in detail in order to use Coq.  This
    section gives just a taste, while a deeper exploration can be
    found in the optional chapters [ProofObjects] and
    [IndPrinciples]. *)

(** We have seen that we can use the [Check] command to ask Coq to
    print the type of an expression.  We can also use [Check] to ask
    what theorem a particular identifier refers to. *)

Check plus_comm.
(* ===> forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n *)

(** Coq prints the _statement_ of the [plus_comm] theorem in the same
    way that it prints the _type_ of any term that we ask it to
    [Check].  Why? *)

(**  The reason is that the identifier [plus_comm] actually refers to a
    _proof object_ -- a data structure that represents a logical
    derivation establishing of the truth of the statement [forall n m
    : nat, n + m = m + n].  The type of this object _is_ the statement
    of the theorem that it is a proof of. *)

(** Intuitively, this makes sense because the statement of a theorem
    tells us what we can use that theorem for, just as the type of a
    computational object tells us what we can do with that object --
    e.g., if we have a term of type [nat -> nat -> nat], we can give
    it two [nat]s as arguments and get a [nat] back.  Similarly, if we
    have an object of type [n = m -> n + n = m + m] and we provide it
    an "argument" of type [n = m], we can derive [n + n = m + m]. *)

(** Operationally, this analogy goes even further: by applying a
    theorem, as if it were a function, to hypotheses with matching
    types, we can specialize its result without having to resort to
    intermediate assertions.  For example, suppose we wanted to prove
    the following result: *)

Lemma plus_comm3 :
  forall n m p, n + (m + p) = (p + m) + n.

(** It appears at first sight that we ought to be able to prove this
    by rewriting with [plus_comm] twice to make the two sides match.
    The problem, however, is that the second [rewrite] will undo the
    effect of the first. *)

Proof.
  intros n m p.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  (* We are back where we started... *)
Abort.

(** One simple way of fixing this problem, using only tools that we
    already know, is to use [assert] to derive a specialized version
    of [plus_comm] that can be used to rewrite exactly where we
    want. *)

Lemma plus_comm3_take2 :
  forall n m p, n + (m + p) = (p + m) + n.
Proof.
  intros n m p.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  assert (H : m + p = p + m).
  { rewrite plus_comm. reflexivity. }
  rewrite H.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** A more elegant alternative is to apply [plus_comm] directly to the
    arguments we want to instantiate it with, in much the same way as
    we apply a polymorphic function to a type argument. *)

Lemma plus_comm3_take3 :
  forall n m p, n + (m + p) = (p + m) + n.
Proof.
  intros n m p.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  rewrite (plus_comm m).
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** You can "use theorems as functions" in this way with almost all
    tactics that take a theorem name as an argument.  Note also that
    theorem application uses the same inference mechanisms as function
    application; thus, it is possible, for example, to supply
    wildcards as arguments to be inferred, or to declare some
    hypotheses to a theorem as implicit by default.  These features
    are illustrated in the proof below. *)

Example lemma_application_ex :
  forall {n : nat} {ns : list nat},
    In n (map (fun m => m * 0) ns) ->
    n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n ns H.
  destruct (proj1 _ _ (In_map_iff _ _ _ _ _) H)
           as [m [Hm _]].
  rewrite mult_0_r in Hm. rewrite <- Hm. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** We will see many more examples of the idioms from this section in
    later chapters. *)
